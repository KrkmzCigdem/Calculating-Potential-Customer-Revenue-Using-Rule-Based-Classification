# 🎮 Rule-Based Classification for Estimating Potential Customer Revenue

This project demonstrates a rule-based classification approach to estimate the potential revenue generated by new customers for a gaming company, using demographic and behavioral data.

---

## 📊 Business Objective

A gaming company aims to:
- Define **level-based personas** using features like `country`, `device`, `gender`, and `age`.
- Segment these personas based on their average revenue contribution.
- Predict the **average revenue potential** for new customers based on their persona and assign them to appropriate segments.

---

## 🧠 Dataset Information

The dataset `persona.csv` includes:
- `PRICE`: Amount spent by the customer
- `SOURCE`: Device type used (`android` or `ios`)
- `SEX`: Customer gender
- `COUNTRY`: Country of the customer
- `AGE`: Customer age

> Note: The dataset includes multiple records for the same user group due to multiple purchases.

## 🧩 Project Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Check unique values, frequencies, and basic descriptive statistics.
- Analyze sales by country, source, and demographic breakdown.

### ✅ Task 2: Revenue Analysis by Features
- Group data by `COUNTRY`, `SOURCE`, `SEX`, and `AGE` to get average revenues.

### ✅ Task 3: Sorting
- Sort customer groups by `PRICE` to see the most valuable combinations.

### ✅ Task 4: Index Flattening
- Reset index for cleaner data manipulation.

### ✅ Task 5: Age Categorization
- Convert continuous `AGE` into categorical intervals such as: `0_18`, `19_23`, `24_30`, `31_40`, `41_66`.

### ✅ Task 6: Creating Personas
- Combine features into a new variable `customers_level_based` using this structure:


- Group by these personas and calculate average revenue.

### ✅ Task 7: Segmentation
- Segment personas into 4 groups (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) based on quartiles of average revenue.

### ✅ Task 8: Revenue Prediction
- Predict the average revenue and segment of new users using their demographic persona.

## 🧪 Example Predictions

```python
# 33-year-old female from Turkey using Android
"TUR_ANDROID_FEMALE_31_40" → Segment: B, Expected Revenue: ~300-500+

# 35-year-old female from France using iOS
"FRA_IOS_FEMALE_31_40" → Segment: A, Expected Revenue: High
